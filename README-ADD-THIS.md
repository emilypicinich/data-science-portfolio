# Data Science Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This repository publishes my portfolio website using GitHub Pages (Option 1: `/docs` folder).

**Live site:** https://emilypicinich.github.io/data-science-portfolio/

## How it works
- The static site lives under `/docs` (GitHub Pages serves this directory).
- Each project has a short case study in `/docs/projects/<slug>.md` and links back to the corresponding code in `projects/<slug>/`.
