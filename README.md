# Data Science Portfolio

This repository publishes my portfolio website using GitHub Pages.

**Live site:** https://emilypicinich.github.io/data-science-portfolio/

## How it works
- The static site lives under `/docs`.
- Each project has a short case study in `/docs/projects/<slug>.md` and links back to the corresponding code in `projects/<slug>/`.
